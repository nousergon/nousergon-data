"""store/schema_version.py — ArcticDB data-plane schema-version stamp + the
producer-side pre-append assert (alpha-engine-config-I3241).

Motivating incident (config-I3236, 2026-07-21): a schema-additive feature PR
(nousergon-data#742) shipped the *code* half (three new columns) but not the
*data* half (a one-time rewrite of the existing static-schema ``universe``
symbols). The first ``daily_append`` after merge emitted the widened column
set against the old descriptor → 904/904 ``StreamDescriptorMismatch`` → EOD
NAV-reconcile prod-down. The mismatch surfaced two layers downstream as an
opaque ``RuntimeError`` in ``executor/eod_reconcile.py``.

This module is the runtime half of the fix: the ``universe`` data plane now
carries a monotonic integer schema version, and producers assert it matches
what their code emits BEFORE touching any symbol — converting the failure
from a mass mid-write descriptor cascade into a single loud, actionable
pre-flight error that names the pending migration.

Stamp LOCATION — a dedicated ``universe_schema_meta`` library, NOT a reserved
symbol inside ``universe``:

    ``nousergon_lib.arcticdb.get_universe_symbols()`` returns
    ``lib.list_symbols()`` UNFILTERED, and that set is consumed fleet-wide as
    the tradable-ticker roster (executor VWAP/ATR guards, backtester replay,
    predictor inference). A reserved ``_schema_meta`` symbol placed in
    ``universe`` would therefore leak into every consumer's ticker roster as a
    phantom "ticker" — a contract-bypassing cross-module coupling. Isolating
    the stamp in its own library keeps the ``universe`` symbol namespace pure
    (zero consumer changes) at the cost of one extra library-open per producer
    run.

    Failure modes of this choice, and how they are handled:
      * meta library absent/empty (legacy pre-framework state, or a fresh
        bucket) → ``read_schema_version`` returns ``None`` → callers treat the
        universe as being at the BASELINE version (see ``assert_schema_version``).
      * the stamp and the ``universe`` data are written non-atomically during a
        migration → migrations stamp LAST, only after ``verify()`` passes, and
        every migration is idempotent, so a crash between the data rewrite and
        the stamp leaves a re-runnable state (re-run re-verifies, re-stamps).
